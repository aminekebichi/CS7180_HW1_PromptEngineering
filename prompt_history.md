# Prompt History

1.  Please generate a detailed readme for this project. Here is the breakdown:

    The objective of this project is to master effective prompting through iteration and experimentation. There will be 3 challenges. For each challenge we will:
    - Write an initial prompt (v1)
    - Generate code and test
    - Iterate and improve prompt (v2, v3, etc.)
    - Document what made prompts better
    - Compare code quality across versions

2.  Please create a seperate text file in which we will store all prompts that I prove you in chronological order of when they were asked. Please create this as an ordered list of prompts.

3.  Before committing any changes, we do not need the date specified for each entry of the prompt_history

4.  Please add a description of each challenge to the readme:

    Challenge 1: Easy (25%)
    Task: Email validation function with regex

    Create a function that validates email addresses
    Handle common edge cases (plus addressing, subdomains)
    Include test cases
    Challenge 2: Medium (35%)
    Task: React sortable/filterable data table with pagination

    Sortable columns (click to sort)
    Filter by text input
    Pagination (configurable page size)
    Proper TypeScript types
    Challenge 3: Hard (40%)
    Task: Caching layer with TTL, LRU eviction, persistence

    Time-to-live (TTL) for entries
    Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction when full
    Persistence to localStorage or file
    Configurable max size
