# Prompt History

1.  Please generate a detailed readme for this project. Here is the breakdown:

    The objective of this project is to master effective prompting through iteration and experimentation. There will be 3 challenges. For each challenge we will:
    - Write an initial prompt (v1)
    - Generate code and test
    - Iterate and improve prompt (v2, v3, etc.)
    - Document what made prompts better
    - Compare code quality across versions

2.  Please create a seperate text file in which we will store all prompts that I prove you in chronological order of when they were asked. Please create this as an ordered list of prompts.

3.  Before committing any changes, we do not need the date specified for each entry of the prompt_history
